This folder includes all instances used in the numerical experiments in Section 
6 for the paper "Robust optimization for models with uncertain SOC and SDP 
constraints" by Jianzhe Zhen, Frans de Ruiter, Ernst Roos & Dick den Hertog.

The folder contains a total of 450 instances all named according to the 
following convention:
N_M_I.mat
Here, N is the dimension of the problem, M is the number of constraints in the
polyhedron and I is the instance number (that runs from 1 to 50 for each set of 
N and M).
